# Communication for Custom Developer Tools (Code)

This is the code example for a blog post called [Communication for Custom Developer Tools](https://blog.khanacademy.org/communication-for-custom-developer-tools/) that shares some notes learned during a recent hackathon. The idea is to create a custom browser extension that extends developer tools for easier, less intrusive debugging of a host application.

## Application

`/application` is the host application build with Create React App.

1. Go to the `/application` directory: `cd application`
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn` (or `npm install`)
3. Start the application: `yarn start` (or `npm start`)

## Dev Tools

`/dev-tool` is the browser extension.
